# HTML_CSS_JS_Windows11Demo
This is a Demo of how Windows 11 looks like. Coded from scratch with the help of HTML, CSS and JS

I have made this project just to test out the all new Windows 11. As windows 11 is not supported in many devices, People who are curious like me
could test out the demo. For running the project simply install live server extension in VSCode. A few bugs will be fixed and some extra features will be added in future. 

If anyone wants to contribute, feel free to make a pull request.

Live demo of the project is shown below:-
